      The first row of upgrades can be purchased endlessly for increasing costs
      <span :ach-tooltip="costScalingTooltip">
        <i class="fas fa-question-circle" />
      </span>
      and the rest are single-purchase.
      <br>
      Single-purchase upgrades also have requirements which, once completed, permanently unlock the ability
      to purchase the upgrades at any point.
      <span :ach-tooltip="possibleTooltip">
        <i class="fas fa-question-circle" />
      </span>
      <br>
      Locked upgrades show their requirement and effect by default; unlocked ones show
      their effect, current bonus, and cost. Hold shift to swap this behavior.
      <br>
      You can shift-click upgrades with <i class="fas fa-lock-open" /> to make the game prevent you
      from doing anything this Endgame which would cause you to fail their unlock condition.
